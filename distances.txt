Approach I have followed but couldn't succeced in it:

* Generated data of 1500 samples
* Radomly selected two points as starting points and ending points.
* Plotted those points on the graph
* Then constructed a list containing the distance between starting point and rest of points.
* Then sorted the list and took the minimum distance and considered as starting point and stored previous starting point in prev
* Checked the condition where the starting point and prev are same or not
* If they are not same, then iterated over the points and calculated the distances.
* I have choosen that condition because at some point they become equal.
